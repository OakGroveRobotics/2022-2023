Welcome to To FTC 17628, Oak Grove Robotics, TeamCode module

Here you can find our collection of submodules that we implement when programming our Robot. We do reference a few outside repositories, 
so before repurposing any of our code make sure you check out the build.gradle file in our TeamCode module for those dependencies. 

Please contact us @ OakGroveRobotics@gmail.com or through our GitHub for any questions or concerns.
